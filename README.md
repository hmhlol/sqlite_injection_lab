This lab is ctf style lab. You can submmit the flag you get from challenge. There are only 6 challenges and only boolean based blind injection challenges.

Sorry for too many css files as I am training my front-end skill but I am still too bad in it :neutral_face: :neutral_face: .

You can reset the database. And if you don't like the default flag, you can customize the flag.
